# Detection of plastic using Hyper-spectral Images
Deep Learning Course Project on Detection of  plastic on surfaces using reflectance values of hyper-spectral bands. The report for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Deceptrax123/Plastic-Detection-using-Reflectance-Images-of-Hyperspectral-Bands/blob/Main/deep_learning_report.pdf">here</a>

## Building
You may view <a href="https://github.com/Deceptrax123/Plastic-Detection-using-Reflectance-Images-of-Hyperspectral-Bands/blob/Main/BUILDING.md">Building.md</a> for steps to run the test scripts or train scripts from scratch. We have included the weights for all tested models within the same specified path in the source code. Therefore, no path changes are required for running test scripts.

## Data
We collected the data for this project which can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q2_CAj3QjnvgVoTAN9JjOVqS3_BDlvBR?usp=sharing">here</a>. You may combine all 4 folds as a single fold before running the train/test scripts.
